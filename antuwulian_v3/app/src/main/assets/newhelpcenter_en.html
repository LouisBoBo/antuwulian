        <label><b>2.What should I pay attention to when charging the device?</b></label>
        <div>
            <p><b class="answer">Answer:</b></p>
            <p class="p">(1) During the charging period, the status of the power indicator light is steady red, and the red indicator light is off when it is full. You can check the power of the device through the client (mobile APP or computer).</p>
            <p class="p">(2) Use the charger to connect to the factory-configured data cable for charging. It takes about 11-13 hours for the device to fully charge, and the charger output current needs to be above 1A. The smaller the current, the slower the charging.</p>

        <label><b>5.Why IoT cards do not support remote monitoring?</b></label>
        <div>
            <p><b class="answer">Answer:</b></p>
            <p class="p">The remote monitoring function is to monitor by way of call, so it is necessary to use a SIM card with a voice call function, and the Internet of Things card only has a GPRS Internet access function and no call function. Remote monitoring will generate a certain amount of call charges, which will be charged by the local carrier of the user according to the local package fee.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b class="answer">Answer:</b></p>
            <p class="p">Due to the occlusion of reinforced concrete, the GPS satellite signal cannot be received indoors, so the GPS signal indicator will always be bright indoors. What is the positioning in the room? When the GPS signal cannot be received, it will generally be converted to LBS mobile phone base station positioning or WIFI positioning.</p>
